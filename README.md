This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is a small frontend application of Carna mobile app.

## How to run the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`
### `open -n -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --args --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev_test" --disable-web-security` 

The last script is to fix the CORS issue.
